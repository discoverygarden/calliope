<body>THE TRAGEDIE OF KING LEAR.
<h3 class="head-italic">Actus Primus. Scaena Prima.</h3>
<p class="stage-italic">Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmond.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I Thought the King had more affected the Duke of <span class="italics">Albany</span>, then <span class="italics">Cornwall.</span></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
It did alwayes seeme so to us: But now in the division of the Kingdome, it appears not which of the Dukes hee valewes most, for qualities are so weigh'd, that curiosity in neither, can make choise of eithers moity.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Is not this your Son, my Lord?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
His breeding Sir, hath bin at my charge. I have so often blush'd to acknowledge him, that now I am braz'd too't.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I cannot conceive you.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
Sir, this yong Fellowes mother could; whereupon she grew round womb'd, and had indeede (Sir) a Sonne for her Cradle, ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it, being so proper.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
But I have a Sonne, Sir, by order of the Law, some yeere elder then this; who, yet is no deerer in my account, though this Knave came somthing fawcily to the world before he was sent for: yet was his Mother fayre, there was good sport at his making, and the horson must be acknowledged. Doe you know this Noble Gentleman, <span class="italics">Edmond</span>?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Edm.</span>
No, my Lord.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
My Lord of Kent:
Remember him heereafter, as my Honourable Friend.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Edm.</span>
My services to your Lordship.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Edm.</span>
Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
He hath bin out nine yeares, and away he shall againe. The King is comming.</p>
<p class="stage-italic">Sennet. Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Gonerill, Regan, Cordelia, and attendants.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Attend the Lords of France &amp; Burgundy, Gloster.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glou.</span>
I shall, my Lord.<br></p><p class="stage-italic">Exit.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Meane time we shal expresse our darker purpose.<br>
Give me the Map there. Know, that we have divided<br>
In three our Kingdome: and 'tis our fast intent,<br>
To shake all Cares and Businesse from our Age,<br>
Conferring them on yonger strengths, while we<br>
Unburthen'd crawle toward death. Our son of <span class="italics">Cornwal,</span><br>
And you our no lesse loving Sonne of <span class="italics">Albany,</span><br>
We have this houre a constant will to publish<br>
Our daughters severall Dowers, that future strife<br>
May be prevented now. The Princes, <span class="italics">France</span> &amp; <span class="italics">Burgundy,</span><br>
Great Rivals in our yongest daughters love,<br>
Long in our Court, have made their amorous sojourne,<br>
And heere are to be answer'd. Tell me my daughters<br>
(Since now we will divest us both of Rule,<br>
Interest of Territory, Cares of State)<br>
Which of you shall we say doth love us most,<br>
That we, our largest bountie may extend<br>
Where Nature doth with merit challenge. <span class="italics">Gonerill,</span><br>
Our eldest borne, speake first.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Gon.</span>
Sir, I love you more then word can weild the matter,<br>
Deerer then eye-sight, space, and libertie,<br>
Beyond what can be valewed, rich or rare,<br>
No lesse then life, with grace, health, beauty, honor:<br>
As much as Childe ere lov'd, or Father found.<br>
A love that makes breath poore, and speech unable,<br>
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
What shall <span class="italics">Cordelia</span> speake? Love, and be silent.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Of all these bounds even from this Line, to this,<br>
With shadowie Forrests, and with Champains rich'd <br>
With plenteous Rivers, and wide-skirted Meades<br>
We make thee Lady. To thine and <span class="italics">Albanies</span> issues<br>
Be this perpetuall. What sayes our second Daughter?<br>
Our deerest <span class="italics">Regan,</span> wife of <span class="italics">Cornwall</span>?<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Reg.</span>
I am made of that selfe-mettle as my Sister,<br>
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,<br>
I find she names my very deede of love:<br>
Onely she comes too short, that I professe<br>
My selfe an enemy to all other joyes,<br>
Which the most precious square of sense professes,<br>
And finde I am alone felicitate<br>
In your deere Highnesse love.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Then poore <span class="italics">Cordelia</span>,<br>
And yet not so, since I am sure my love's<br>
More ponderous then my tongue.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
To thee, and thine hereditarie ever,<br>
Remaine this ample third of our faire Kingdome,<br>
No lesse in space, validitie, and pleasure<br>
Then that conferr'd on <span class="italics">Gonerill.</span> Now our Joy,<br>
Although our last and least; to whose yong love,<br>
The Vines of France, and Milke of Burgundie,<br>
Strive to be interest. What can you say, to draw<br>
A third, more opilent then your Sisters? Speake.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Nothing my Lord.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Nothing?<br></p>

<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Nothing.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Nothing will come of nothing, speake againe.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Unhappie that I am, I cannot heave<br>
My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty<br>
According to my bond, no more nor lesse.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>How, how <span class="italics">Cordelia</span>? Mend your speech a little,<br>
Least you may marre your Fortunes.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Good my Lord.<br>
You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me.<br>
I return those duties backe as are right fit,<br>
Obey you, Love you, and most honour you.<br>
Why have my Sisters Husbands if they say<br>
They love you all? Happily when I shall wed,<br>
That Lord, whose hand must take my plight, shall carry<br>
Halfe my love with him, halfe my Care, and Dutie,<br>
Sure I shall never marry like my Sisters.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
But goes thy heart with this?<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
I my good Lord.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
So young, and so untender?<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
So young my Lord, and true.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Let it be so, thy truth then shall be thy dowre:<br>
For by the sacred radience of the Sunne,<br>
The miseries of <span class="italics">Heccat</span> and the night:<br>
By all operation of the Orbes,<br>
From whom we do exist and cease to be,<br>
Heere I desclaime all my Paternall care,<br>
Propinquity and property of blood,<br>
And as a stranger to my heart and me,<br>
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous <span class="italics">Scythian,</span><br>
Or he that makes his generation messes<br>
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosome<br>
Be as well neighbour'd pittied, and releev'd,<br>
As thou my sometime Daughter.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Good, my Liege.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Peace <span class="italics">Kent.</span><br>
Come not betweene the Dragon and his wrath,<br>
I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest<br>
On her kind nursery. Hence and avoid my sight:<br>
So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br>
Her Fathers heart from her: call <span class="italics">France,</span> who stirres?<br>
Call <span class="italics">Burgundy, Cornwall,</span> and <span class="italics">Albanie,</span><br>
With my two daughters Dowres, digest the third,<br>
Let pride, which she cals plainnesse, marry her:<br>
I doe invest you jointly with my power,<br>
Preheminence, and all the large effects<br>
That troope with Majesty. Our selfe by Monthly course,<br>
With reservation of an hundred Knights,<br>
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode<br>
Make with you one due turne, onely we shall retaine<br>
The name, and all th'addition to a King: the Sway,<br>
Revennew Execution of the rest,<br>
Beloved Sonnes be yours, which to confirme,<br>
This Coronet part betweene you.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Royall <span class="italics">Lear,</span><br>
Whom I have ever honor'd as my King,<br>
Lov'd as my Father, as my Master follow'd,<br>
As my great Patron thought on in my praiers.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Le.</span>
The bow is bent &amp; drawne, make from the shaft.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Let it fall rather, though the forke invade<br>
The region of my heart, be <span class="italics">Kent</span> unmannerly,<br>
When <span class="italics">Lear</span> is mad, what wouldest thou do old man?<br>
Think'st thou that dutie shall have dread to speake,<br>
When power to flattery bowes?<br>
To plainnesse honour's bound,<br>
When Majesty falls to folly, reserve thy state,<br>
And in thy best consideration checke<br>
This hideous rashnesse, answere my life, my judgement:<br>
Thy yongest Daughter do's not love thee least,<br>
Nor are those empty hearted, whose low sounds<br>
Reverbe no hollownesse.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
<span class="italics">Kent,</span> on thy life no more.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
My life I never held but as pawne<br>
To wage against thine enemies, nere feare to loose it,<br>
Thy safety being motive.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Out of my sight.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
See better <span class="italics">Lear,</span> and let me still remaine<br>
The true blanke of thine eie.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kear.</span>
Now by <span class="italics">Apollo,</span><br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lent.</span>
Now by <span class="italics">Apollo,</span> King<br>
Thou swear.st thy Gods in vaine.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
O Vassall! Miscreant.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Alb. Cor.</span>
Deare Sir forbeare.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Kill thy Physition, and thy fee bestow<br>
Upon the foule disease, revoke thy guift,<br>
Or whil'st I can vent clamour from my throate,<br>
Ile tell thee thou dost evill.<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lea.</span>
Heare me recreant, on thine allegeance heare me;<br>
That thou hast fought to make us breake our vowes,<br>
Which we durst never yet; and with strain'd pride,<br>
To come betwixt our sentences, and our power.<br>
Which, nor our nature, nor our place can beare;<br>
Our potencie made good, take they reward.<br>
Five dayes we do allot thee for provision,<br>
To shield thee from disasters of the world,<br>
And on the sixt to turne thy hated backe<br>
Upon our kingdome; if on the tenth day following,<br>
Thy banisht trunke be found in our Dominions,<br>
The moment is thy death, away. By <span class="italics">Jupiter,</span><br>
This shall not be revok'd,<br></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Fare thee well King, sith thus thou wilt appeare,<br>
Freedome lives hence, and banishment is here;<br>
The Gods to their deere shelter take thee Maid,<br>
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said:<br>
And your large speeches, may your deedes approve,<br>
That good effects may spring from words of love:<br>
Thus <span class="italics">Kent,</span> O Princes, bids you all adew,<br>
Hee'l shape his old course, in a Country new.<br></p> <p class="stage-italic">Exit.</p>
