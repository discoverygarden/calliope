<h3 class="head">M. William Shake-speare His History, of King Lear.</h3>
Enter Kent, Glocester, and Bastard.
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I Thought the King had more affected the Duke of <span class="italics">Albeney</span>, then <span class="italics">Cornewall.</span></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glost.</span>
It did alwaies seeme so to us, but now in the division of the Kingdomes, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither, can make choise of eithers moitie.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Is not this your sonne, my Lord?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glost.</span>
His breeding sir hath beene at my charge. I have so often blusht to ackowledge him, that now I am braz'd to't.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I cannot conceive you.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glost.</span>
Sir, this young fellowes mother could, whereupon she grew round wombed, and had indeed Sir a sonne for her Cradle, ere she had a husband for her bed, do you smell a fault?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glo.</span>
But I have sir a sonne by order of the Law, some yeare elder then this, who yet is no deerer in my account, thogh this knave came something sawcely to the world before he was sent for yet was his mother faire, there was good sport at his making, &amp; the whoreson must be acknowledged, do you know this noble gentleman, <span class="italics">Edmond</span>?</p>

<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Bast.</span>
No my Lord.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glo.</span>
My Lord of <span class="italics">Kent,</span>
remember him heereafter, as my honourable friend.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Bast.</span>
My services to your Lordship.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Bast.</span>
Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glo.</span>
He hath beene out nine yeares, and away he shall againe, the King is comming.</p>
Sound a Sennet. Enter one bearing a Coronet, then Lear, then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall, next Gonerill, Regan, Cordelia, with followers.
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Attend the Lords of <span class="italics">France</span> and <span class="italics">Burgundy, Gloster.</span></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Glost.</span>
I shall, my Liege.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Meane time we shal expresse our darker purposes.
The Map there; know we have divided
In three our Kingdome: and tis our first intent,
To shake all cares and businesse from our state,
Confirming them on younger yeares,
The two great Princes, <span class="italics">France</span> and <span class="italics">Burgundy,</span>
Great Rivals in our yongest daughters love,
Long in our Court, have made their amorous sojourne,
And here are to be answer'd; tell me my daughters,
Which of you shall we say doth love us most,
That we, our largest bounty may extend,
Where merit doth most challenge it:
<span class="italics">Gonerill</span> our eldest borne, speake first.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Gon.</span>
Sir, I love you more then word can wield the matter,
Dearer then eye-sight, space, and liberty,
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,
No lesse then life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,
As much as childe ere loved, or father friend,
A love that makes breath poore, and speech unable,
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
What shall <span class="italics">Cordelia</span> do, love, and be silent.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shady forrests, and wide-skirted Meades
We make thee Lady, to thine and <span class="italics">Albanies</span> issue,

Be this perpetuall. What saies our second daughter?
Our deerest <span class="italics">Regan,</span> wife to <span class="italics">Cornwall,</span> speake.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Reg.</span>
I am made of that selfe-same mettall as my Sister is,
And prize me at her worth in my true heart,
I find she names my very deede of love, onely shee came short,
That I professe my selfe an enemy to all other joyes,
Which the most precious square of sense professes,
And finde I am alone felicitate in your deere highnesse love.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Then poore <span class="italics">Cordelia</span>, and yet not so, since I am sure
My love's more richer then my tongue.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
To thee, and thine hereditary ever
Remaine this ample third of our faire kingdome,
No lesse in space, validity, and pleasure
Then that confirm'd on <span class="italics">Gonerill</span>; but now our joy,
Although our last, not least in our deere love,
What can you say, to win a third, more opulent
Then your Sisters?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Nothing my Lord.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
How, nothing can come of nothing, speake againe.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth, I love your Majesty according to my bond, no more nor lesse.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>Go too, go too, mend your speech a little,
Least you may marre your fortunes.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
Good my Lord.
You have begot me, bred me, loved me.
I return those duties backe as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you,
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say they love you all?
Haply when I shall wed, that Lord, whose hand
Must take my plight, shall carry halfe my love with him,
Halfe my care and duty, sure I shall never
Marry like my Sisters, to love my father all.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
But goes this with thy heart?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
I good my Lord.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
So young and so untender?</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cor.</span>
So young my Lord, and true.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Well let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower,
For by the sacred radience of the Sunne,
The mistresse of <span class="italics">Heccat</span> and the might:
By all operation of the Orbes,
From whom we do exist and cease to be,
Heere I desclaime all my paternall care,
Propinquity and property of bloud,
And as a stranger to my heart and me,
Hold thee from this for ever, the barbarous <span class="italics">Scythian,</span>
Or he that makes his generation
Messes to gorge his appetite,
Shall be as well neighbour'd, pittied, and releeved,
As thou my some-time daughter.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Good my Liege.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Peace <span class="italics">Kent,</span> come not betweene the Dragon and his wrath
I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kinde nursery, hence and avoid my sight:
So be my grave my peace as here I give,
Her fathers heart from her; call <span class="italics">France,</span> who stirres?
Call <span class="italics">Burgundy, Cornwall,</span> and <span class="italics">Albany,</span>
With my two daughters dower digest this third,
Let pride, which she cals plainnesse, marry her:
I do invest you joyntly in my power,
Preheminence, and all the large effects
That troope with Majesty, our selfe by Monthly course
With reservation of an hundred Knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turnes, onely we shall retaine
The name and all the additions to a King,
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sonnes be yours, which to confirme,
This Coronet part betwixt you.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Royall <span class="italics">Lear,</span>
Whom I have ever honor'd as my King,
Loved as my Father, as my Master followed,
As my great Patron thought on in my praiers.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
The bow is bent and drawne, make from the shaft.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Let it fall rather,
Though the forke invade the region of my heart,
Be <span class="italics">Kent</span> unmannerly, when <span class="italics">Lear</span> is mad,
What wilt thou do old man, think'st thou that duty
Shall have dread to speake, when power to flattery bowes,
To plainnesse honours bound, when Majesty stoops to folly,
Reserve thy doome, and in thy best consideration
Checke this hideous rashnesse, answere my life,
My judgement, thy yongest daughter does not love thee least,
Nor are those empty hearted, whose low sound
Reverbs no hollownesse.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
<span class="italics">Kent,</span> on thy life no more.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
My life I never held but as a pawne
To wage against thy enemies, nor feare to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Out of my sight.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
See better <span class="italics">Lear,</span> and let me still remaine
The true blanke of thine eie.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Now by <span class="italics">Apollo--------</span></p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Now by <span class="italics">Apollo,</span> King thou swear'st thy Gods in vaine.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Vassall, recreant.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Do kill thy Physition
And the fee bestow upon the foule disease,
Revoke thy doome, or whil'st I can vent clamour
From my throate, ile tell thee thou dost evill.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Lear.</span>
Heare me, on thy alleigeance heare me;
Since thou hast fought to make us breake our vow,
Which we durst never yet; and with straied pride,
To come between our sentence and our power,
Which, nor our nature, nor our place can beare,
Our potency made good, take they reward,
Foure dayes we do allot thee for provision,
To shield thee from diseases of the world,
And on the fift to turne thy hated backe
Upon our kingdome; if on the tenth day following,
Thy banisht trunke be found in our Dominions,
The moment is thy death, away
By <span class="italics">Jupiter,</span> this shall not be revokt,</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="speaker">Kent.</span>
Why fare thee well King, since thus thou wilt appeare,
Friendship lives hence, and banishment is here;
The Gods to their protection take the maid,
That rightly thinkes, and hath most justly said,
And your large speeches may your deedes approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love:
Thus <span class="italics">Kent,</span> O Princes, bids you all adew,
Hee'l shape his old course, in a Country new.</p>
